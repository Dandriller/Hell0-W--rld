# Hell0-W--rld
My first repository


Today is the first day I will start my journey to learning code (23/02/19). I will start with basic web development, [CSS, HTML, Javascript] and decide whether or not I will continue with more advanced versions, or branch into something different. 

This isn't my first time attempting learning this subject, but hopefully it will be the last attempt, resulting in completion. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk nerds
